# Should you add this repo to your resume / LinkedIn?

## Add it if:
- You want to signal "systems thinking" and "automation mindset"
- You interview for roles where process/tooling matters (platform, backend, data)
- The repo is clean, documented, and clearly sanitized (no personal info)

## Don't add it if:
- It's unfinished or hard to understand
- It exposes any sensitive content
- It distracts from your core engineering narrative

## Recommended approach (balanced)
- Add to LinkedIn Featured + Projects
- Add 1–2 bullets under Professional Development
- Mention in interviews only when relevant (tooling, process reliability, automation)

## How to frame it
- Reliability & state management
- Deterministic outputs and validation
- Low-maintenance weekly refresh model
