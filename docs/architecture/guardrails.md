# Guardrails

## Privacy
- Never commit personal, medical, or sensitive info to a public repo.
- Use placeholders and dummy content.

## Truth-only
- Do not invent experience, projects, metrics, tools, dates, or affiliations.
- If unknown: mark as unknown and ask.

## Ownership + dedupe
- Each rule/template belongs to exactly one owner file.
- Other files may contain a single pointer line (optional), but no duplication.

## Anti-clutter defaults
- Single-row tracker per company/role
- Reminders are outstanding items only (no history log)
- Schedule contains short-horizon commitments only

## View-limit awareness
- If earlier context may be missing, recommend a new chat
- Use NEW CHAT BOOTSTRAP to carry forward only the essentials
