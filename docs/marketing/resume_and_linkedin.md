# How to market this on your resume + LinkedIn (without exposing personal data)

## Resume (best placement)
Place under:
- "Professional Development"
or
- "Projects" (if you already have that section)

### 2 strong resume bullets (template)
- Built a **Project Pack workflow** for using ChatGPT on recurring professional tasks, using an ownership-based context index, thread lifecycle rules, and deterministic patch outputs (tracker/reminders/schedule).
- Created a lightweight toolchain (Python scripts) to **validate context integrity** and **version/update headers**, enabling weekly refreshes with low maintenance overhead.

Optional (if true for you - keep generic, avoid sensitive details):
- Designed a "single-row" pipeline tracker + reminder export flow to reduce admin overhead and keep workstreams moving.

## LinkedIn profile (where to mention)
- Featured section: link the repo
- About: 2–3 lines max
- Projects: add as "ContextOps Project Pack (Open-source template)"

### Short "About" snippet
I built an open-source template for a **Project Pack workflow** that makes ChatGPT more reliable for repeatable work: ownership-based context files, view-limit-aware thread lifecycle, and deterministic patch outputs for tracking/reminders/scheduling.

## How to talk about it in interviews
- "I wanted consistency, not prompt chaos."
- "I treat assistant behavior like a system: ownership, contracts, and validation."
- "The key is reducing cognitive load without leaking sensitive info."

## What NOT to say publicly
- Do not mention private context content.
- Do not list employer-specific or sensitive details.
- Do not share medical/personal data workflows.
