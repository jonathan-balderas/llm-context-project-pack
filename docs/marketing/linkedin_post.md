I open-sourced a **sanitized template** of a system I use to work with ChatGPT more reliably on repeatable workflows.

The idea is simple:
- Keep context in a **Project Pack ZIP** (source of truth)
- Maintain a **Context Index** that defines what each file "owns"
- Avoid long-chat failures with **thread lifecycle + new-chat bootstraps**
- Produce deterministic outputs: **TRACKER PATCH → REMINDER PATCH → SCHEDULE PATCH**
- End-of-day: export reminders in a calendar-ready format

This repo is a public template with dummy data - no personal or sensitive info.

If you've felt "prompt chaos" when using AI assistants, you might find this useful:
- better consistency
- less context switching
- easier maintenance

Feedback welcome - especially from people building reliable assistant workflows.
